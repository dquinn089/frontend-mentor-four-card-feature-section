## Overview

This is my submission for my sixth Frontend Mentor project, built with vanilla HTML and CSS. I decided for the "mobile-first" approach for this, seeing that the mobile layout was much simpler to create. Although the general styling for this project was relatively simple, the grid and flexbox layouts were a bit a challenge figuring out a way to set up the grid without overcomplicating the code.

## My process

First, HTML structure. Second, mobile CSS styling and layout. Third, media queries for larger screen styling and layout using grid. Adjusted margin and gap properties for the larger screens. Fourth and finally adding transition animations to the cards for fun. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Learned a lot more about the fundementals of both flexbox and grid, allowing for more clarity when planning ahead for layouts in these projects.

### Continued development

While I generally prefer to deepen my expertise in a select few programs rather than spread myself too thin, I am eager to start working with libraries more in the future. I'm seeking web design tips that will enable me to minimize time spent on styling so I can focus more on functionality.
